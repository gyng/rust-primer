## Rust

> Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.

<!-- We're here to get a high-level answer to the questions: what and why Rust? -->

---

## Me

- First line of Rust code in 2014
- Intermediate **_(!)_** Rust programmer

<!-- I learn more about programming the more I write Rust -->

---

## Rust experience

A few small and medium-sized ($\lt$ 5K LoC) Rust programs in production

<!-- I would write more in production, if I could -->

---

## Bulk CSV data sanitizer

Count, parse, clean terrabytes of CSV

- small 32-core server in an on-premise server
- 50$\times$ speed up over (somewhat optimised) Python
- 30$\times$ over PyPy

---

## Kubernetes job monitor sidecar

## Objectives

Answer the question: Why should I try Rust?

- Rust setup
- A taste of Rust programming
- Write a simple, semi-realistic program at the end
- Use the tools you would use for real (= no web toy examples!)

---

## Non-objectives

- Anything beyond the basics
- A good understanding of using the basics of Rust

<!-- It took my newbie programmer brain weeks before I felt comfortable with Rust. -->

---

# It's okay to come out of this without a complete understanding of what happened!

It's about getting a first impression
