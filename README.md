## Rust

>Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.

<!-- We're here to get a high-level answer to the questions: what and why Rust? -->

---

## Me

- First line of Rust code in 2014
- Intermediate ___(!)___ Rust programmer

<!-- I learn more about programming the more I write Rust -->

---

## Rust experience

A few small and medium-sized ($\lt$ 5K LoC) Rust programs in production

<!-- I would write more in production, if I could -->

---

## Bulk CSV data sanitizer

Count, parse, clean terrabytes of CSV

- small 32-core server in an on-premise server

- Write a simple, semi-realistic program at the end

---

## Non-objectives

<!-- It took my newbie programmer brain weeks before I felt comfortable with Rust. -->
