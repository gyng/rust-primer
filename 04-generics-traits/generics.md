# Generics and Traits

Creating safe, reusable code

- If you've done programming in a typed language this will probably be familiar
- Rust implements generics over traits
- Traits are supercharged interfaces!
- Can be implemented for existing types (you can't do this in Java!)
  - Traits are implemented on structs, structs do not implement traits
- Similar to type classes in Haskell or Scala
  - Some features not yet implemented

---

## Exercise

- Generics on structs and functions
- Using traits as interfaces
- (Not going to cover trait objects)
