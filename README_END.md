# Congratulations!

Your brain can now parse most Rust code online

---

## Bad stuff

- Learning curve
- Relativly young ecosystem
- Compile times (especially vs. Go)

---

## Good stuff

- If it compiles, it works
- Compiler writes code for you
- Modern tooling
- Fast
- Quality standard library

---

## Gooder stuff

- Hard to shoot yourself in the foot
- Forces me to be explicit about handling possible edge cases

---

## Goodest stuff

- Models your problem for you

<!-- Most important thing I like about Rust
    -
 -->

---

## Goodestest stuff

- Able to sleep well at night

---

## Good? stuff

- No runtime
- Bright future

---

## What do people use Rust for

- CLI tools

## Objectives (again)

Why should I try Rust?

- Rust setup
- A taste of Rust programming
- Write a simple, semi-realistic program at the end

---

## Questions

- Was it easy to get started?
- Was the compiler helpful?
- Was tooling (cargo, rustfmt, clippy) good?
- Was testing code easy?
- Were the docs good?
- Did you have confidence in your program when it compiled?
- What did you like or dislike about this taste of Rust?

---

## Next steps

- Learn Rust
- See what's going on in Rustland
- Rust at workplace?
