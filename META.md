# About the slides

The slides use [Marp](https://marp.app/), a lightweight markdown slide creation tool.

The quickest way to get started is to use VS Code's [Marp extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode).

Add this to the start of a slide deck

```
---
marp: true
---
```

and use `hr` to demarcate slides

```
---
```

Then use a Marp command from VSC's command palette (⌘ ⇧ <kbd>Space</kbd>). Use the regular Markdown preview command for developing slides.
