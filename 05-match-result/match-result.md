## enums

- Not your grandfathers's enums
- More similar to algebraic data types (ADTs) than boring constants

## Result, Option

- no `null` in Rust

`Result`: `Ok`, `Err`
`Option`: `Some`, `None`

## Pattern matching

- Switch/Case statement on steroids
- Similar to those from more functional languages
