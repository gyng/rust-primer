## Exercies

- Containerise build
- CI: tests, fmets, building in alpine
- Bonus: cargo t, clippy, audit
- Doc generation, testing your docs
- Release: targbench, fuzzing, quickcheck
- Bonus: Error handling ecosystem, error reporting and tracking

## Objectives

- Look at objectives again

## Questions

- Was it easy to get started with/install?
- Was the compiler helpful?
- Was tooling (cargo, rustfmt, clippy) good?
- Was testing code easy?
- Were the docs good?
- Did you have confidence in your program when it compiled?
- What did you like or dislike about this taste of Rust?

## Good stuff

- Developer productivity
- Compiler writes code for you
- If it compiles, it works
- Modern tooling
- Performant: all the things you have seen today have zero runtime cost
- Hard to shoot yourself in the foot = even better for more-junior programmers
- Able to sleep well at night while on call

## Bad stuff

- Learning curve
- Relativly young ecosystem
- Compile times (vs Go)

## Good? stuff

- No runtime
- Bright future

## What do people use Rust for

- CLI tools
- WASM
- Web (no Django/Rails/Spring equivalent yet)
- APIs
- Games
- Performance-sensitive code
- Libraries (to C, JS)
- Embedded

## Who is using Rust?


## Next steps

- learn Rust
- see what's going on in Rustland
- Rust at workplace?

## I'll hang around, happy to talk about anything

- learning Rust
- Rust at work
- projects in Rust
- Rust vs other languages
